# free_team_11
The repository of free team 11

Status: 
- set up project, configuration and structure 
- set up all needed activities and screens
- added navigation between activities (as far as possible)
- added all needed layout elements and some very basic design

Important notes: 
- Didn't add the "back" buttons (!!!) because this behaviour is already implicitely implemented in android 
  and it is not allowed to have extra back buttons, so please don't add any :)


Next TODOs: 
- database and xml design (if nobody fancies this task I will do it in the course of the next days to have basic functionality)
- lots of test cases
- better design of layout
